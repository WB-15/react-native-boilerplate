React Native Boilerplate is a starting point for React Native application. This project is configured with redux, redux saga 
and redux persist. Latest version of react-navigation with NavigationService instead of Redux Integration.


## Scalability Factor

This Type based Architecture scales smoothly for small - medium apps. If you guys are building a very large application I would suggest using the following feature based architecture which will be more developer friendly with ease of scaling.

## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodejs.org) v8.10 (it is recommended to install it via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A development machine set up for React Native by following [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

## Getting Started

10. Latest versions of react-naviagtion uses gesture handler which is native module. For android you have to do some additional steps to configure them. Follow [these instructions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)
## FYI: Navigation should work fine even without these but when u need gestures or drawer navigation you need this setup
