React Native Boilerplate is a starting point for React Native application. This project is configured with redux, redux saga 
and redux persist. Latest version of react-navigation with NavigationService instead of Redux Integration.


## Scalability Factor

This Type based Architecture scales smoothly for small - medium apps. If you guys are building a very large application I would suggest using the following feature based architecture which will be more developer friendly with ease of scaling.
