=======================================

[![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Native-v0.57-blue.svg)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
[![React Navigation V2](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Navigation-v2.16-blue.svg)](https://reactnavigation.org/)


React Native Boilerplate is a starting point for React Native application. This project is configured with redux, redux saga 
and redux persist. Latest version of react-navigation (v2.16) with NavigationService instead of Redux Integration.


## Scalability Factor

This Type based Architecture scales smoothly for small - medium apps. If you guys are building a very large application I would suggest using the following feature based architecture which will be more developer friendly with ease of scaling.
